In this paper I explore the way in which actors in a bilingual Spanish and Yucatec Maya production of La conjura de Xinum discuss their method of creating a character. Using information gathered through ethnographic fieldwork, I argue that the actors, as they discuss their method of character creation are using the Maya language creatively, and that their idea of character creation is informed by both western traditions of acting and an understanding of ontology based within a Maya cultural worldview. This argument reveals the way in which these actors are creatively engaging with a variety of influences which they combine strategically to align with their overall goal of language and cultural revitalization through their work in the theatre.
