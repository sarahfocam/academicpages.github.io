This course in play analysis is open to any student, regardless of major, and focuses on the analysis of play texts predominantly for practice and criticism. Students in the course will develop skills the necessary skills in practice and criticism in order to refine their work as theatre artists. Students will also be exposed to literary theory (more specifically, theory for theatre) to enhance their understanding of the scholarship within theatre and performance studies. Students will have the opportunity to apply their skills in practice, criticism, and theory through class discussions, assignments, and projects. The course texts will focus on plays written/produced within the American theatre in last twenty years.

Learning Outcomes
======
By the end of the course, students will be able to: 
- describe why script analysis is a necessary part of the work we do as theatre artists
- evaluate the tools of script analysis and apply the relevant tools to a specific play
- understand how play texts differ from productions of play texts
- isolate specific pieces of evidence from script and use them to support interpretations about the play, which in turn affect choices in production 
- create their own approach to script analysis, combining their pre-existing tools with those learned in class. 


Course Components
======
**Play Reflection Blog.** For this assignment, you will respond to a brief prompt for each of the plays that we read in class. These responses can be a mix of video, audio, and text. I encourage you to experiment with responding in all the modalities offered, but if you prefer one modality that is ok too! There will be a total of 15 of these responses. 

**Final Paper or Project.** –Choose your favorite below! 300 points. 
1.	Paper Option: Write a 5-8-page paper (due by the end of the semester). The topic is completely up to you (within the scope of the class) but could focus on a play, a series of play texts, a playwright, or a theatrical event.
2.	Project Option: Let your imagination run wild! Have you always wanted to design the set for Taylor Mac’s Hir? Perhaps you are really into the work of Adrienne Kennedy and you want to create a dramaturgy packet on one of her plays. Project should be approved by me by midterm. We will work together to design a rubric for your specific project.

*Scaffolding for this final paper/project assignment is as follows:* 
    Topic proposal (4-5 sentence description of your project) 
	Draft of Grading Rubric for your Final Paper/Project 
	Paper/Project 

**Special Assignments** 

*SA 1: Character Analysis in Action.* For this assignment, you will practice the art of performance analysis. While performance analysis is not the same as script analysis, you will use the same tools (observations/evidence and interpretation/analysis) in the practice. We will watch a segment from Anna Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles and focus on the acting choices that Deavere Smith made in the portrayal of the character.

*SA 2: Play Annotations and Dramaturgical First Steps.* For this assignment, you will annotate ten pages of the play *Mestiza Power!* by Concepción León Mora (translated by Virginia Grise). Annotations will be followed up by creating a glossary (in the style of a dramaturgical packet) of the terms found in the script. 

*SA 3: Style Analysis.* This informal writing assignment asks that you analyze the style in the play *Straight White Men* by Young Jean Lee.
