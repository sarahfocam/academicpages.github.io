Course Components
======

**Worksheets** – Worksheets will be handed out at the start of each class period and will be filled in as you follow along in the lecture, activities and/or discussion for each class period. You are responsible for completing 20 of the 26 total worksheets. Worksheets will be collected at the end of each week. You should plan to keep these for reference throughout your time as a theatre student – they will be very helpful references! 

**Final Project/Presentation.** – Throughout the semester, you will be working on a final project for the class. This could be a number of things – performing a scene from one of the plays we studied (along with script/character analysis), a scenic model, costume renderings, dramaturgical packet, audience guide, create a bunraku puppet (!!), or another similar project. During the second-to-last week of classes, you will present your work to the class. 

**Paper** – The 5-7-page research paper will be over a topic of your choosing from within the periods we are studying for the course (Ancient Egypt to 1700). Topics will need to be approved in advance by the instructor. This paper will be broken down into the following parts: 
1.	Abstract - The abstract is a summary of your topic for your research paper. Guidelines for the abstract will be posted in advance of the due date. 
2.	Annotated Bibliography - The annotated bibliography is a list of 5-7 sources that you will use for your final paper. These sources should include annotations, where you describe the usefulness of that particular source to your project. 
5.	Paper - 5-7 pages.
