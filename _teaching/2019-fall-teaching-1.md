In this course we will be exploring the field of dramaturgy. More specifically, we will focus on dramaturgy as an act; an act that can be done by a dramaturg or by anyone else involved in creating/producing a work of theatre or performance. By expanding the view of dramaturgy as an action, the hope is that students will be able to apply the technique of dramaturgy to their own work, even if they aren’t working as a dramaturg.

Learning Outcomes
======
At the end of the course students will: 
- understand the development of the dramaturg in different theatrical traditions throughout history
- understand the role of a dramaturg and learn to work successfully as/with a dramaturg on any project in the future
- learn the techniques and skills of the position and apply it to their own work in theatre
- use library resources to conduct research 
- become more familiar with scholarly journals and reading for comprehension and synthesis.

Course Components
======
**Class Discussion Leader Assignment.** Select a text (or two) from a day’s assigned reading and lead the class in a 15-20-minute discussion. This assignment assesses your ability to read critically for the main idea(s) and synthesize what you’ve read. If you are joining via Zoom, the assignment will be slightly modified (unless you want to try for the discussion via Zoom!). 

**Dramaturgical Experience Assignment.** Short informal reflection essay (500-1000 words) on your experience with the field of dramaturgy. If you have no direct experience being a dramaturg or working with a dramaturg, focus on how you’ve used research in your past work in the theatre. 

**Precritical Response Assignment.** Short informal essay on play of your choice. 

**Source Evaluation Assignment and Annotated Bibliography.** Brief assignment assessing your ability to find and analyze the relevance of sources for your research as well as ability to compile an annotated bibliography. This should be completed on the same play that you selected for the precritical response. 

**Extended Dramaturgical Program Essay.** The “classic” dramaturgy assignment: write a 750-1000-word essay on the play of your choice (the same as for the source evaluation and precritical response assignments). Your audience for this particular document is the theatre audience. More specific guidelines will be distributed during the semester. 

**Final Project.** The final project should be a capstone for the course. Some possibilities are: audience outreach or an interactive dramaturgical lobby display for a production at the university, a dramaturgical protocol for a hypothetical production, a new play dramaturgy project, a syllabus for an undergraduate or graduate level dramaturgy course, an essay where you theorize your relation to dramaturgy, an actor packet for a hypothetical (or real) production, a dance or circus dramaturgical project, etc.!
