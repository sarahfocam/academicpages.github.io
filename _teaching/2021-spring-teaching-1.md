Theatre Pedagogy Lab examines current trends and advances in teaching theatre in K-12 settings as well as in higher education. The course is structured as a horizontal learning experience with the instructor as facilitator. Throughout the semester we will explore the history of theatre in educational settings, educational philosophies and approaches, assessment of instructors and students, how to create a community of learners, etc. The course will incorporate scholarship from outside the field of theatre which we will work to incorporate into our own practice as educators. This course will function as a meta-pedagogical experiment; I have designed the course to mirror many of the approaches and methods that we will discuss in class.

Learning Outcomes
======
By the end of the course, students will be able to: 
- discuss the history of theatre in education settings, 
- work collaboratively with educators across the country, 
- apply concepts, techniques, and methods discussed in class to their own practice as educators, 
- discuss their teaching philosophy,
- use library resources to conduct research, 
- and analyze existing curricula, syllabi, assignments, and assessments for strengths and weaknesses, and provide suggestions for improvement. 



Course Components
======

There are two assignment tracks for the course: an individual-based one and a collective-based one. The **individual assignment track** is focused on developing a teaching portfolio and the **collective-based** one is focused on developing resources and problem-solving in a group. Each track will consist of two assignments, each worth 250 points. Additionally, each student will be responsible for profiling a digital teaching tool and presenting on it in class as well as providing feedback on two syllabi, each worth 250 points.

**Individual Track – Developing a Teaching Portfolio**
Choose any two assignments below: 

1. Statement of Teaching Philosophy. The statement describes your personal philosophy as a teacher. What do you value? How do you, in general, engage students? 
2. Sample Syllabi. This should contain at least one new syllabus and a collection any other syllabi that you have developed over your teaching career. 
3. Diversity Statement – this statement should focus on how you incorporate diversity into your teaching and how, in general, you value diversity in education. 
4. Sample Lesson Plans, Learning Objects, etc. – this section of the teaching portfolio should include the development of at least two new lesson plans or learning objects for a course that you would like to teach (ideally, this should match your syllabus). 
5. Educator Website – using the materials developed above (or what you have completed previously) build a website for your educator-self. This site can be hosted on a number of different platforms but should at the very least include your statement of teaching philosophy and some syllabi or assignment descriptions. 

**Collective Track – Developing Teaching Resources and Problem-Solving in the Classroom**
Choose any two assignments below: 

1. Journal-Length (6,000-8,000 words) Article. This should be co-written by no more than three students on a subject relevant to course topics or focus on a current issue in theatre pedagogy. 
2. Contributions to an Undergraduate Level Play Analysis Open Textbook. The contributions for this are wide-ranging but could include developing a table of contents for the text, contributing a chapter, developing a learning object, research on hosting platforms, etc. 
3. Curriculum Development. Working together in a group of no more than three, develop and refine an existing curriculum, or propose a new curriculum. This could be at your institution or for a hypothetical one. I encourage you to work with folks from across the country and even in different grade levels. 
4. Sample Lesson Plans, Syllabi, Learning Objects, etc. With a partner, develop lesson plans, a syllabus, or learning objects for a course that you would like to teach.  
5. Assessment Plan. For a course that you teach or would like to teach, develop a plan for assessment using the tools we have discussed in class. Use the existing standards at your institution(s) to develop an assignment that will engage students while also providing relevant and insightful data for assessment. This can be a collective project with up to one other student. 
6. Problem and Plan of Action Assignment. In groups of no more than three, identify a problem that you face as an educator or that you have faced as a student. Conduct research on the issue and develop a plan of action for how to solve the problem or issue. Example problems could include: student engagement on Zoom, handling 'disruptive' students with compassion, challenges to curriculum redesign, when students don’t meet learning outcomes, etc.
