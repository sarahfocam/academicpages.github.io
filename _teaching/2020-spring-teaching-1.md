This course will examine the foundations of the American theatre from the late 18th Century through the mid-20th Century. The goal of the course is to provide students with a firm historical and theoretical foundation for the majority of American plays that they will encounter as contemporary theatre artists. Special attention will be paid to movements and/or plays that established tropes that still predominate in the contemporary American theatre. This course features plays that may be emotionally challenging, racist, sexist, classist, or otherwise frustrating. Contact me if you have concerns or need to chat about this.

Learning Outcomes
======
By the end of the course, students will be able to: 
- understand how the myth of exceptionalism informed the works written for the American stage
- discuss the major tropes of early American theatre
- discuss how historical events are interpreted for the stage
- conduct research on a topic, develop a thesis, and argue in support of that thesis in a research paper
- describe the major developments in the American theatre scene from the mid-18th century to the 1930s.

Course Components
======

**Attendance/Participation** – Attendance is expected in the course. Since we only meet 15 times throughout the semester, it is critical that you don’t miss a session. That being said, there are of course times when attending class is not possible. If this does happen, you can watch the recorded session and send a brief summary of your thoughts/impressions/questions from that class period and from the readings. These responses are due within a week of the missed class period. Students are expected to participate in the class discussions. Aim for contributing to the discussion at least once per class period. 

**Presentations** – There will be two presentations for the course throughout the semester and you will be able to sign up for the day you’d like to present. These presentations will be 8-10 minutes and should focus on a play, historical event, or playwright (or other topic as approved by instructor) from the time period that we are currently studying, but that we aren’t addressing directly in the course. It is totally fine to overlap your presentations with your paper topic. I am happy to provide ideas or guidance! 

**Paper** – There will be one 12-18-page paper due at the end of the semester. The topic is completely up to you (within the scope of the class) but could focus on a play, a series of play texts, a playwright, or a theatrical event. I will scatter due dates throughout the semester so that you can build up to this length rather than it being due all at once. This paper will be broken down into the following parts: 
1.	Abstract 
2.	Annotated Bibliography
3.	Outline 
4.	First draft
5.	Final draft
