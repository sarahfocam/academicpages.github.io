This seminar focuses on two of the key figures in the theatre for social change movement in the twentieth century: Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal. The course examines the aesthetics, dramatic/theoretical texts, and rehearsal/working practices of Brecht and Boal and how they built upon and departed from previous movements in the theatre. We will also look to how these practitioners have inspired artists across the globe in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

Course Components
======
**Theatre in Society – Personal Artistic Manifesto.** This text/sketch/doodle will express your goals for theatre in your community. What issues are affecting individuals where you live or work? How can theatre empower audience members to expand their horizons – whether through education, protest, social disobedience, or entertainment? Your personal manifesto is a completion-only grade. You do the assignment; you get the points. No word count/page minimum, I highly encourage you to take out a piece of computer paper and handwrite/sketch/paint/doodle your manifesto! We will set up a virtual class art gallery (just for the viewing by members of our course) of our manifesto creations. 

**Innovative Pedagogy Experiment.** Using a text from the day’s assigned reading, lead the class in a 15-20-minute innovative learning exercise. This assignment assesses your ability to read critically for the main idea(s) and synthesize what you’ve read into a specific pedagogical intervention designed to achieve specific goals. The hope is that each student will explore different strategies for teaching in the discipline of theatre; this then provides students with a wealth of options for teaching in future courses. A description of your activity is due on the day that you present it. 

**Open Educational Resource.** For this assignment, you will create an informative presentation that can be used by theatre practitioners and instructors (whether you share the final product is up to you, however). This could be a pre-recorded presentation on Zoom using PowerPoint, it could be a short documentary, or a recorded interview with an expert on the topic. If you decide to share, the resource can be posted publicly and licensed under Creative Commons for use by anyone.

**Community Research Project.** With this project, you will respond to a series of questions about the place in which you live (or what you consider to be your artistic home); the social, economic, political, or other issues in your community (ex - homelessness, police brutality, lack of internet access, ICE raids, food deserts, COVID-19 hotspots, etc.); the community organizations that are already in place in your community that help with this issue (if present); an action plan that you could take to address this issue (on a non-theatre level, perhaps with legislation, protest, etc.); an action plan that you could take to address this issue (with theatre). It is important that this project, at this phase be research and planning ONLY. If you have not yet been a vital part of social justice or organizing in the community, the project might inadvertently cause harm. The goal for the project is to get to know your community better. 

**Paper/Project/Syllabus** – Choose your favorite below! 

*Paper Option:* Write an 8-10-page paper (due by the end of the semester). The topic is completely up to you (within the scope of the class) but could focus on a play, a series of play texts, a playwright, or a theatrical event.

*Project Option:* Let your imagination run wild! Have you always wanted to design the set for Brecht’s Baal? Perhaps you are really into the work of Augusto Boal and would like to design a workshop of theatre of the oppressed in your classroom or community. Project should be approved by me by midterm. We will work together to design a rubric for your specific project. 

 *Syllabus Option:* Are you a pedagogy-focused student? Design a syllabus at the any level (secondary, undergraduate, graduate, etc.) related to the course topics. Syllabi should include course description, learning objectives/outcomes, assignment descriptions, approximate class schedule with readings and assignments.
