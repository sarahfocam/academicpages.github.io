This seminar focuses on two of the key figures in the theatre for social change movement in the twentieth century: Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal. The course examines the aesthetics, dramatic/theoretical texts, and rehearsal/working practices of Brecht and Boal and how they built upon and departed from previous movements in the theatre. We will also look to how these practitioners have inspired artists across the globe in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

Course Components
======
**Theatre in Society – Personal Artistic Manifesto.** This text/sketch/doodle will express your goals for theatre in your community. What issues are affecting individuals where you live or work? How can theatre empower audience members to expand their horizons – whether through education, protest, social disobedience, or entertainment? Your personal manifesto is a completion-only grade. You do the assignment; you get the points. No word count/page minimum, I highly encourage you to take out a piece of computer paper and handwrite/sketch/paint/doodle your manifesto! We will set up a virtual class art gallery (just for the viewing by members of our course) of our manifesto creations.
