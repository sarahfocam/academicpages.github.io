This article was presented as part of the Articles in Progress Symposium at the Mid-America Theatre Conference "(MATC)" 

The image of the radical and rebellious indio is prevalent throughout the Americas. In Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, this image is primarily centered upon a 19th-century war, commonly referred to as the Caste War of Yucatán (1847-1901). Despite its name, contemporary historians argue that the war was not exclusively due to race relations in the peninsula, but rather a constellation of forces (economic, social, and religious) that led to a war lasting more than 50 years. The Caste War is a point of pride in the peninsula, especially in the state of Quintana Roo and in the small town of Tihosuco, considered by many to be the epicenter of the conflict and its residents rebels par excellence. Recent ethnographic literature, however, has pointed to the extent to which the image of the rebellious indio has been pushed upon the residents of Tihosuco by anthropologists and historians. Yet many in the town of Tihosuco strongly identify with this identity and perform the story of the rebellion each year in a play called La conjura de Xinum.  

In this article I explore this point of contention in the Maya community of Tihosuco over the image of the rebellious indio through data from four performances of the play La conjura de Xinum. First, I focus on how the artists are using the discourse of rebellion in their work by examining the use of the Maya language in performance. In the production, the alternation of the Maya and Spanish languages can be seen as a strategic “acting out,” negotiating contemporary Maya identity within the frame of an official history, an account of the peninsula’s Caste War. I analyze language use on three levels - verisimilar language, meta-language, and performative language - to demonstrate how speaking in Maya is framed as a radical and rebellious act. Using data from interviews with the actors and director I explore how the creators believe that the discourse of rebellion is operating in the play and their reasons for it.  

Finally, I turn to recent ethnographic literature on the resettlement of Tihosuco in the mid-20th century. Ethnographer Luis Caamal Caamal argues that such a homogenized view of the residents of Tihosuco as rebels has led to stereotyping and discrimination both within and outside of the community. Using Caamal Caamal’s work, linguistic data from the four performances and my own interviews, I aim to present a nuanced view of performance and identity in the peninsula in order to understand the ways in which the Maya perform this rebel identity both on and off stage.
