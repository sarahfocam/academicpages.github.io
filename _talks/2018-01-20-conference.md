Abstract
---

In this paper I highlight two bodies of literature which aided me in my fieldwork in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where I studied the performances of the play 'La conjura de Xinum,' over the course of three years, from 2015-2017. First, using Victoria Bricker and Juan Castillo Cocom’s work, I highlight the importance of grammatical categories of language for understanding conceptions of time and, by extension, an understanding of history. Diana Taylor’s <i>Archive and the Repertoire<i> led me to focus on the transmission of performance knowledge in the rehearsal process (aided by Richard Schechner’s discussion of transmission methods).
