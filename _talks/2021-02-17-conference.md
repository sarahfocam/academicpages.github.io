Despite the fact that dramaturgy is not a particularly new field, dramaturgs are often left in confusing and frustrating situations in terms of their level of contribution and involvement on a production; they might find themselves sitting in a corner of the room at rehearsals or trying to erase their presence at a design meeting. This is further complicated in university settings where student dramaturgs might be given little guidance and assigned to work with faculty or guest directors who are unsure of how best to have the student contribute. In Navigating the Relational Dynamics of Dramaturgy, we will focus on developing an action plan as a dramaturg on a project; the goal of this plan is to help student dramaturgs recognize how their strengths can complement the needs of a given production. While focused on empowering the student of dramaturgy, this workshop will also be helpful for faculty and anyone else in a university setting who interacts with dramaturgs.
