Abstract
---

In this paper, I examine the way in which the playwrights have staged the action of the play, *La Gran Familia*, to reflect contemporary crises within the Mexican government and how a figure such as the title character, Mama Rosa, could be created by social, religious, and political forces in modern Mexico.
