Director's Note
---

**“THIS IS BIGGER THAN ALL OF US,”** Rosa says to the other characters in the play “The Haven” by Ian Paul Messersmith. These words have echoed in my mind since my first time reading the play over a year ago. In that time, we have seen how quickly a pandemic can rip through world economies, sending those already facing precarity, into dispossession. “The Haven” speaks to that precarity; to the thin veil that often separates those who help and those who need help. The play shows that sometimes our best
efforts will not be enough to save what we love and shows us all the while the commitment it takes to serve and love one another. “The Haven” is the result of two years of development and inspired by the playwright’s years of activism in shelters in Southern California.
